"""Anonymize a directory of captured HP CDP JSON before it is committed.

Usage:
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/anonymize_cdp.py scripts/captures/192.168.0.64-20260101T120000Z/

The output directory is created next to the input with the suffix ``-anon``.
The script prints every replacement it makes.

Why a separate script from ``anonymize_ledm.py``
-----------------------------------------------
The LEDM capture is XML and the CDP capture is JSON, so the parsing is
different. The two share a *policy* -- same rules about what identifies a
device and what is worth keeping -- but they do not share an implementation,
and merging them would mean one function with a format branch in every step.
What must not be duplicated is the pipeline within one format: ``main`` here
calls :func:`anonymize_file`, which is the only place the JSON pipeline
exists, for the same reason the XML side has a single entry point.

What it removes
---------------

- Device identity: serial number, device UUID, service ID, SKU, derivative
  number.
- Per-consumable serial numbers.
- User-typed free text: ``deviceDescription`` and ``deviceLocation`` are
  editable from the printer's own web UI, so they can carry a room name or a
  person's name.
- ``productNumber`` is replaced with the captured ``makeAndModel`` so the
  fixture still says what device it came from without carrying the SKU.
- IPv4 / IPv6 literals anywhere in a value, for the same reason the XML
  anonymizer does it: an address in a committed fixture is both an identifier
  and a way for a reader to infer the network.

What it deliberately keeps
--------------------------

Counters, dates, states, capabilities, media names, event codes, and SNMP
*settings* -- ``accessOption``, ``enabled``, ``readOnlyPublicAllowed``. The
community string itself is never returned by the device, only whether one is
set, so there is no credential in this capture to remove.

**This is a best-effort filter over the keys seen so far.** It cannot know
about a field on a model nobody has captured yet. Read the diff before
committing, and cover every new key in ``tests/test_anonymize_cdp.py``.
