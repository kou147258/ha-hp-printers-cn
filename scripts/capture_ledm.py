"""Capture LEDM XML from a live printer for use as test fixtures.

Run this from a machine on the same network as the printer. It fetches the
endpoints the integration reads and writes each response under
``scripts/captures/<host>-<timestamp>/`` so it can be reviewed and
anonymized before being committed.

Usage:
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_ledm.py --host 192.168.0.64
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_ledm.py --host printer.local --port 8080
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_ledm.py --host 192.168.0.64 --output ./raw

The script is read-only: every request is a ``GET``. Some printers may rate
limit or refuse traffic from unknown User-Agents, so we send a normal
browser-like header and sleep briefly between requests.
