"""Anonymize a directory of captured LEDM XML before it is committed.

The capture script writes raw responses, which contain identifiers that
should not appear in a public repository. This script replaces the values
of well-known identifier tags with stable dummies, while preserving the
field *names* and the rest of the XML structure so the parser tests
exercise the same shapes the device emits.

Usage:
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/anonymize_ledm.py scripts/captures/192.168.0.64-20260101T120000Z/

The output directory is created next to the input with the suffix
``-anon``. The script prints every replacement it makes.

What it removes
---------------

- Device identity: serial number, UUID, ServiceID, SKU, friendly name.
- Cartridge identity: per-cartridge serial numbers.
- Network identity: every spelling of the hostname, the MAC in both
  ``HardwareAddress`` and the Bonjour service name, IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses (validated as addresses, so an enum such as ``100TX_FULL``
  survives), and the domain name.
- ``ProductNumber`` becomes the captured ``MakeAndModel``, so the fixture
  still says what device it came from without carrying the SKU.

What it deliberately keeps
--------------------------

Counters, dates, states, capabilities, and the netmask. A fixture is
worthless if the values are scrubbed too, and none of these identify
anyone.

**This is a best-effort filter over tag names we have seen.** It cannot
know about a field on a model nobody has captured yet. Read the output
diff before committing, and if a new endpoint is added to
``capture_ledm.py``, go through its identity fields, add them to
``IDENTIFIER_TAGS``, and cover them in ``tests/test_anonymize.py`` --
the network fields were added exactly that way.
