"""Capture HP CDP JSON from a live printer for use as test fixtures.

Run this from a machine on the same network as the printer. It fetches the
endpoints the integration reads and writes each response under
``scripts/captures/<host>-<timestamp>/`` so it can be reviewed and
anonymized before being committed.

Usage:
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_cdp.py --host 192.168.0.64 --https
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_cdp.py --host 192.168.0.64 --https --port 443
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_cdp.py --host 192.168.0.64 --https --output ./raw

The script is read-only: every request is a ``GET``.

Why this exists alongside ``capture_ledm.py``
---------------------------------------------
Not every HP model serves the LEDM layer. Newer consumer models (Smart Tank
580-590, measured 2026-10) answer ``/DevMgmt/DiscoveryTree.xml`` with 404 and
expose the same facts -- identity, usage counters, consumables, events --
through a CDP REST surface at ``/cdm/<service>/<version>/<resource>``
returning JSON instead of XML.

The discovery document is captured too, precisely so a fixture can record
that a model *lacks* LEDM rather than only recording what it has.

Two transport quirks the print firmware forces on us, both found by
measurement and both worth keeping in the fixture story:

- The printer serves a self-signed certificate, and offers only legacy
  static-RSA cipher suites, so TLS verification is disabled *and* the default
  cipher list has to be relaxed. ``ssl=False`` alone is not enough on every
  build.
- The printer ignores ``Accept-Encoding: identity`` and always answers
  ``Content-Encoding: gzip``; aiohttp decodes that transparently, but a
  hand-rolled HTTP client will read compressed bytes as text.
