"""Client for HP's CDP ("Common Data Platform") JSON interface.

Not every HP model serves LEDM. Newer consumer models -- Smart Tank 580-590
measured 2026-10-05 -- answer ``/DevMgmt/DiscoveryTree.xml`` with 404 and
expose the same facts through a REST surface at
``/cdm/<service>/<version>/<resource>`` returning JSON.

HP publishes no specification for either interface. The endpoint map below was
derived by reading a live device rather than guessed: the paths come out of
the printer's own ``/webApps/*/*.js`` and out of ``resourcePath`` fields in
its own alert payloads, and the 24 endpoints that exist were confirmed by
enumerating 1500 service/version/resource combinations.

The client deliberately mirrors :class:`.api.LEDMClient`'s three methods and
returns the same dataclasses, so nothing above the client layer -- coordinator,
entities, config flow -- has to know which protocol a printer speaks.

        once and never changes on its own, and a config entry keeps this
        object for the whole life of the printer.

        The same reasoning brought six more documents here, and on this
        protocol it is not a preference. Read in ``async_get_data`` they made
        the poll six requests wider, and the CDP models fail the TLS handshake
        under concurrent connections -- so the facts were not wrong, they were
        *absent*, on a varying fraction of refreshes: measured at zero to three
        of six per run, with no error anywhere, because ``_fetch_optional``
        turns a connection failure into an empty document. A poll is already
        twenty-six requests wide and the device is already at its limit; these
        six change when a person reconfigures the printer or loads paper, which
        is not a minute-to-minute event.

        The cost is staleness: up to six hours between reads. That is the right
        trade for "the wireless cipher is aesOrTkip", "the paper loaded is A4"
        and "the last firmware update failed with manifestNotFound", and the
        wrong one for anything that moves. Nothing here does.

        They are fetched with one retry each, and that is the part that
        actually works. Moving them here changed nothing on its own -- measured
        at zero to one of six per refresh, the same as on the poll path -- and
        neither did splitting the gather. The constraint is not which method
        they are read by, it is how many TLS handshakes the device is being
        asked for at once, and the poll is already twenty-six wide. A slow
        refresh that lands while a poll is in flight loses the race whichever
        method it uses, and so does a setup that runs straight after one.

        The same six documents answer 200 five times out of five when fetched
        one at a time with no other traffic, which is what makes a retry the
        right answer rather than more reshuffling: the request is fine, the
        device was busy. A path that runs twice a day can afford one retry
        per document; a poll that runs every minute cannot, which is why this

        integration serves.

        an ink container -- HP's own web UI files these under "printhead" and

        volume. A slot of type ``inkTank`` is the refillable reservoir and is
        the only slot that ever carries a level. Both are kept, because both
        are hardware the user can act on, but they are labelled by what the
        device says they are.
