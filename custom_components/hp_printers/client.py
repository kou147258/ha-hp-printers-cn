"""Pick the client a printer actually speaks.

Two vendor interfaces are in the wild and a single model serves only one of
them:

- **LEDM**, XML under ``/DevMgmt/``, on laser and older consumer models.
- **CDP**, JSON under ``/cdm/``, on newer consumer models. Smart Tank 580-590
  measured 2026-10-05 answers 404 for every LEDM path including
  ``DiscoveryTree.xml``, and serves the same facts over CDP.

Nothing above this module should care which one is in use: both clients
expose ``async_validate`` / ``async_get_product_info`` / ``async_get_data``
and return the same dataclasses. The protocol is therefore discovered, not
configured -- there is no user-facing setting to get wrong, and a printer
that is replaced by a different model on the same DHCP lease re-negotiates on
its own.

Detection order is LEDM first because it is the better-documented of the two
and because a LEDM-capable printer also tends to answer quickly on the first
endpoint, so the probe costs one request in the common case.
