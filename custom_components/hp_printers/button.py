"""Buttons for the maintenance operations the printer itself offers.

Why this platform exists
------------------------
The printer enumerates its own maintenance operations -- three strengths of
ink-path clean, a paper-feed clean, a rib-smear clean, and a printhead
alignment -- and this turns them into buttons. The user asked for buttons
rather than automation, and that is the right shape for this: every one of
these operations spends ink and paper, and a 60-second poll firing one on a
schedule is not something anyone wants.

What is deliberately not here
-----------------------------
No automatic trigger, no script-enabled-by-default, and no "fix my printer"
action. The entity only does something when a person presses it.

Which buttons appear is decided by the device
---------------------------------------------
A button is created only for an operation the printer lists in its own
reports document. A model without a printhead clean has no ``cleaningPage``
to offer, and offering the button anyway produces an error the user would
have to decode. The admin password is not part of this condition: CDP does
not authenticate writes, so gating on it would hide a working feature.
