"""Every entity, built for real, checked against Home Assistant's own rules.

The description tables parse, lint, and are perfectly happy to be wrong.
Home Assistant's answers are stricter, and it expresses them by rejecting the
entity -- with a message that names neither the entity nor the description,
which is why the same fault survived several rounds of table-level checks.

Two of its rules are reproduced here, applied to the built entity rather than
to the description it came from:

* a sensor offering ``options`` must declare the enum device class;
* a sensor with a non-numeric device class must not declare a unit.

Both are read out of Home Assistant's own modules rather than restated, so
this cannot drift from the version the integration actually runs against. The
second rule is what caught a boolean that had been written into the sensor
table: it had an enum device class and no options, so the first rule was
satisfied and only the second one objected -- and the object Home Assistant
rejected was a sensor reading "off" and "on".
