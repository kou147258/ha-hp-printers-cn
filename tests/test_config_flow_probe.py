"""Tests for the config-flow probe and reauth flows.

The probe is what turns a user's host/port/ssl inputs into either a
config entry or one of two error reasons. Reauth simply aborts with a
guidance message, since this integration reads without credentials.

These tests exercise the flow directly rather than going through
``hass.config_entries.flow.async_init``, which requires a live Home
Assistant bootstrap. The probe only depends on ``self.hass`` to
construct an ``LEDMClient``, so we patch both ``async_get_clientsession``
and ``LEDMClient``.
