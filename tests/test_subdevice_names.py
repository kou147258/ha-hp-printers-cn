"""Sub-device names have to survive a translation lookup that misses.

Home Assistant writes a device's name into its device registry when the device
is first created, and that stored value is what the user sees whenever the
frontend cannot resolve the device's translation. With ``translation_key``
alone and a lookup that misses, what gets stored is the key itself.

Measured on a real install: the device page read ``consumable_ink_tank_black``
and ``subunit_copier`` while the entity names immediately beside them were
correctly localised. Entity names arrive pre-resolved from the states API;
device names do not, which is why only the devices were affected and why
looking at the entities gave no hint that anything was wrong.

So every sub-device carries a readable ``name`` as well as a
``translation_key``, and the two are asserted to carry the same text: a
localized frontend should get its own wording, and a user whose lookup missed
should get the same thing rather than a slug.
