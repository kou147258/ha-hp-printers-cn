"""Where an alignment currently is.

The maintenance button added earlier can only say the request was accepted,
and on a semi-automatic model that is most of the job. The printer prints a
pattern, then waits for the user to put it on the scanner glass, and it says
so in a document this integration captured but never read::

    GET /Calibration/State
    <CalibrationState xmlns=".../cnx/markingagentcalibration/2009/04/08"
    >ScanRequested</CalibrationState>

Without it, a printer sitting on ``ScanRequested`` looks idle while the user
is being told the alignment is running. That is the specific gap this closes.
