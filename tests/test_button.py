"""Tests for the maintenance buttons, through the entity layer.

The client's write path has its own tests. These check the part a user
actually touches: which buttons appear on a given printer, and which ones
refuse to fire.

The refusals are the point. A button that fires when it should not spends ink
and paper, and no amount of correct behaviour elsewhere makes that acceptable.
