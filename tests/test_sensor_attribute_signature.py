"""Every printer-level entity's attributes must actually render.

This exists because of a crash that reached no test. Three ``attrs_fn``
lambdas were changed to take ``(data, info)`` so they could read facts off
``ProductInfo``, and the tests that cover those three passed throughout --
because they call ``attrs_fn`` directly with two arguments. The entity calls it
with one, through ``extra_state_attributes``, and every one of those entities
raised a ``TypeError`` the first time Home Assistant rendered it.

Nothing in the suite would have noticed. This file notices.

The check is deliberately structural rather than behavioural: it calls every
description's ``attrs_fn`` the way the entity does, so a signature change
anywhere in the table is caught even where no test names that sensor. A
per-sensor test cannot do this -- the sensors nobody wrote a test for are
exactly the ones that break.
