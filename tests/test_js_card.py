"""The JavaScript card's own checks, kept in the repository rather than in a shell.

Two things about ``examples/cards/hp_printers_card.js`` are only visible by
running it or by reading it against the integration, and both had already gone
wrong once by the time this was written:

* it asked for ``printer_mispick_events`` and ``ews_access_count``, neither of
  which is a translation key this integration publishes -- so two facts simply
  did not appear on the card, with nothing on screen to say so;
* its status pills ran every fact through the binary-switch rule, which drops
  anything whose state is not "on" or "off", so a firmware failure reason of
  ``manifestNotFound`` was treated as neither and hidden.

The key check is here, and it reads the card's source against the
integration's own tables. The behavioural checks need a JavaScript engine, so
they live beside the card in ``test_hp_printers_card.js`` and are run with
``node``; this test only asserts that they are present and that the card
parses as a balanced, non-empty module rather than a stub.
