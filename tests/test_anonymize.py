"""Tests for the fixture anonymizer.

The anonymizer is what stands between a capture from someone's printer and
a public repository, so it gets the same treatment as runtime code. These
tests go through ``anonymize_file`` -- the entry point ``main`` uses -- so
a fix here cannot be undone by a second copy of the pipeline living in the
command-line path.
