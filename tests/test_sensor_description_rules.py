"""Sensor descriptions have to satisfy the rules Home Assistant enforces.

Home Assistant refuses to add a sensor that offers ``options`` without
``device_class = SensorDeviceClass.ENUM``, and raises again on every
subsequent state write. Neither failure names the description that caused it:
one shows up as a missing entity, the other as a coordinator throwing on every
poll. Six sensors here were written with ``state_class=SensorDeviceClass.ENUM``
instead -- a slip that no linter catches, because ``state_class`` accepts any
string and ``SensorDeviceClass.ENUM`` happens to be one.

So the table is checked as a whole, not per sensor: the descriptions that are
wrong are by definition the ones nobody wrote a test for.
