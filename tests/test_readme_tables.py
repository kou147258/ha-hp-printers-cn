"""The README's tables are well formed.

Documentation is the one artefact in this repository that no test touches, and
a broken table row is not a crash: it renders as a stray sentence with pipes
around it, on the page a user reads before installing. Two have now appeared
here -- one from a batch text replacement that merged two rows, one already
in the file before that -- and neither would have been caught by anything
running in CI.

So the check lives here. It compares each row against the column count of the
header of the table it belongs to, which leaves every table free to have its
own width, and it skips fenced code blocks so an example row inside one is not
mistaken for a real one.
