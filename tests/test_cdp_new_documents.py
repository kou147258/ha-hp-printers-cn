"""Six CDP documents that were served the whole time and never opened.

The list this integration fetches was built from what it needed rather than
from what the device offers, so a document answering 200 on every poll went
unread for as long as the integration existed. Two of the six carry facts that
change what a user should do -- the reason a firmware update failed, and
whether the wireless link still allows the legacy cipher.

The file is also where the wireless document's privacy boundary is pinned,
because that is the one place in this integration where a field is present in
the response and deliberately not read:

    "ssid": "CLTX",
    "passPhrase": "password",

An SSID is the user's network name. A pass phrase is a credential. Both would
end up in state attributes and in diagnostics downloads that get pasted into
issue trackers, and neither is needed to answer "is this link encrypted
properly".
