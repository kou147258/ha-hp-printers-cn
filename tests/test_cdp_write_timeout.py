"""Tests for a CDP write whose answer does not come back in time.

Every maintenance button on the Smart Tank 580-590 failed with

    Timeout writing /cdm/report/v1/print; the printer may still be running it

and the measurements say why. On an idle device, one at a time:

    PATCH, reportId the device does not list    -> 400 in 0.02-0.17s
    PATCH, while a report is already running    -> 409 in 0.06s
    PATCH, Printer Status Report                 -> 204 in 3.1s
    that job, read back afterwards               -> processing, then idle
                                                    about 15-20s later

None of that is twenty seconds, and none of it gets slower when a 26-request
poll runs beside it. So the timeout was not a slow network -- it was a report
that takes longer to *accept* than a status page does, because it is doing work
first. The print quality report is the obvious one: it is a diagnostic.

The printer's own web application is the authority on what to do, because it
never waits on the PATCH at all. /webApps/PrintReports/PrintReports.js hands the
job to te.Job2.InternalPrint, whose success callback goes straight to
pollJobState: the PATCH is fired and forgotten, and the job is then read from
the same URL every 3000ms, with 15000ms allowed per request and 300000ms
overall. Every constant here comes from that code.

The property these tests exist to protect is the one that costs paper if it
breaks: a write that times out must never be retried, and must not be reported
as a failure while the printer is still doing the work.
