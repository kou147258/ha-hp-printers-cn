"""What the printhead has actually ejected, and what it could not attribute.

The usage document keeps an ink accounting per station, and it is the
printhead's own tally rather than the cartridge's self-report. That
distinction is the whole reason these are worth reading: a clone chip reports
the genuine part number, so a third-party cartridge presents as HP, and the
one place that disagrees is the head that had to fire the ink.

Two things this file is careful about, both of which are ways to be wrong
here rather than merely incomplete:

* The drop counters are totalled across stations, because each station is a
  different set of heads. The pen-stall counters are taken from one station
  only, because the device repeats the identical block under every station --
  summing those would double all eight numbers, and attributing them to a
  cartridge would tell the user their black cartridge has stalled four
  billion times.
* The pen-stall unit is not published, so there is no total anywhere in this
  file and no sensor that presents one.
