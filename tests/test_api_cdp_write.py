"""Tests for the maintenance write path.

The reads have their own fixture tests. These cover the other half: the
requests that spend ink and paper, and the conditions under which the buttons
refuse to fire at all.

The stance throughout is that a write is the one thing this integration does
that a user cannot undo from Home Assistant, so the paths worth testing are
mostly the refusals. A test that only proves "the PATCH went out" would be
the least useful one in the file.
