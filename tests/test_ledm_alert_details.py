"""The detail block nested inside every LEDM alert.

An LEDM alert is not a flat record. The device puts the identity of the
problem one element down::

    <Alert>
      <ProductStatusAlertID>genuineHP</ProductStatusAlertID>
      <Severity>Info</Severity>
      <AlertPriority>400</AlertPriority>
      <AlertDetails>
        <AlertDetailsMarkerColor>Magenta</AlertDetailsMarkerColor>
        <AlertDetailsConsumableTypeEnum>inkTank</AlertDetailsConsumableTypeEnum>
        <AlertDetailsMarkerLocation>3</AlertDetailsMarkerLocation>
        <AlertDetailsUserAction>acknowledgeConsumableState</AlertDetailsUserAction>
      </AlertDetails>
    </Alert>

The consequence is not cosmetic. ``genuineHP`` is the alert every one of
these printers raises most often, and without the detail it is a complaint
with no subject: no colour, no part, nothing to act on.

Worth being precise about why it went unread, because the obvious explanation
is wrong. ``_text`` resolves a name with ``.//``, so it reaches descendants at
any depth and would have found ``AlertDetailsMarkerColor`` under the nested
block without complaint. The fields were missing because ``ActiveAlert`` was
built from five names and none of them was one of these -- nobody asked, so
nothing was read.
