"""Replay a real anonymized CDP capture against the CDP parser.

Mirrors ``test_api_fixtures.py`` for the JSON interface. The fixture
directory holds a capture from a model that answers 404 to every LEDM path
and serves these documents instead -- which is the case this client exists
for, so the fixture doubles as the record of that.

The fixture is optional: a checkout without it still passes.

To add one:

    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_cdp.py --host <your-printer> --https
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/anonymize_cdp.py scripts/captures/<dir>/
