"""Shared fixtures for bootstrap-level tests.

These fixtures stand up a real ``HomeAssistant`` via
``pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`` so the integration's setup,
unload, and config-flow paths are exercised through Home Assistant's own
config-entry manager rather than by calling functions directly.

``async_build_client`` -- the single seam that constructs a client and
returns its identity -- is patched in both namespaces that bind it:
``custom_components.hp_printers`` (setup) and
``custom_components.hp_printers.config_flow`` (probing).

The patch used to be on ``LEDMClient`` itself. That stopped working when
client construction moved behind the protocol probe: a model serving CDP
never constructs a ``LEDMClient`` at all, so patching that class would let
the CDP path reach the real constructor and try to open a socket. Patching
the probe keeps the tests independent of which protocol a fixture
represents.
