"""What the button platform actually creates, per client.

Counting the description table answers a different question from the one the
user asked, and the difference is exactly where the LEDM model lost its
buttons: the table said fourteen, the platform created none, and only the
platform's number is visible in Home Assistant.

The gate is ``getattr(client, "can_write", False)``. A client that does not
define the property is read-only as far as the buttons are concerned, and it
says nothing -- no error, no failed entity, an empty card. So these tests
drive ``async_setup_entry`` for each client class, and one of them pins the
thing that let it happen: both clients must declare a write path.
