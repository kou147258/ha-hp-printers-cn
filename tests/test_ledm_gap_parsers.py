"""The LEDM readings the *Cap.xml gap analysis turned up.

Every assertion here is a value the Smart Tank 750 actually returned. The
gap analysis worked by differencing three sets -- what the capability document
declares, what the values document actually contains, and what the parser
asks for -- and this file pins the third against the second, so the
difference cannot silently grow back.

Two of these tests exist because the first run of the parsers read the wrong
subtrees. A field placed beside its name rather than where the document puts
it returns None without raising, which is a parser that looks finished and
reads nothing.
