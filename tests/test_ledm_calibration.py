"""The LEDM calibration write path.

The interface this covers was written off as absent before it was read. It is
in DiscoveryTree.xml, at ``/Calibration/CalibrationManifest.xml`` -- one path
segment deeper than the 324 candidates tried, every one of which built the
path as ``/CalibrationManifest.xml/...`` and answered 404. Nothing about the
printer says it cannot align; what said that was a wrong prefix.

So the expectations here are read out of the printer's own manifest rather
than written down here. That is the only reason this file can claim anything
about correctness: a test asserting the request "looks like" the one in the
printer's browser would pass on any plausible-looking XML, and a
plausible-looking XML is exactly what produced two wrong implementations
earlier. The manifest pairs each URI with the element its body carries, so
deriving the expectation from it fails loudly on a wrong namespace -- and the
namespace here is the one thing that cannot be guessed, because it is the only
one on this device that does not sit under ``.../con/ledm/...``.

    GET  /Calibration/Capabilities  -> the routines on offer
    POST /Calibration/Session       -> <cal:CalibrationState>Printing</...>
