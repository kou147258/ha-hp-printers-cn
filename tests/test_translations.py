"""Checks on the translation files that CI would otherwise only catch remotely.

Home Assistant matches translations to strings.json by key, not by content.
A missing key silently falls back to the English string, and a key that no
longer exists is dead weight nobody notices -- neither raises anything, so
hassfest is the only thing that would catch it, and it runs after a push.
Placeholders are the same trap: a dropped {device} renders a sentence with a
literal brace in it rather than failing.

The CJK check is the copy-paste guard. Every string in this integration is
prose -- no brand names, no code, no serial formats -- so a translated value
with no CJK in it is an untranslated leftover rather than a deliberate
exception. The one thing that is not prose is a value made entirely of
placeholders, which has no language to it in the first place.

Device names are the other half of this file's job. A sub-device is named by
a translation_key rather than by a string the integration assembles, which is
what lets "Black Cartridge" become "黑色墨盒" -- the two halves reorder, and
neither is left in English. The price is that a key the translation files do
not declare is not a missing string but a device whose *name* is the key, so
the expected key set is derived from const.py rather than trusted.
