"""The two call sites and the protocol probe, tested the way Home Assistant runs them.

Both defects fixed in the same pass were invisible to the suite, and for the
same reason: the tests exercised the functions while the real failures were in
the *call sites* and in a branch the tests stubbed out.

1. ``async_build_client`` takes ``password`` as keyword-only, and the setup
   entry point passed it sixth, positionally. Every test called the function
   directly with a keyword, so the one place in the integration that spells
   the call out for Home Assistant was the one place never checked. The
   assertion is therefore about the source, not about behaviour: a positional
   password is a syntax-level mistake and a behavioural test is the wrong
   instrument.

2. The CDP identity document was read through the retrying helper, which
   turns a failure into an empty document. That document is what makes a
   machine a CDP device: the protocol probe relies on it *failing* to move on
   to the LEDM client, so the LEDM model could not be set up at all. The test
   below drives the probe the way the config flow does and asserts it still
   rejects a machine that will not produce an identity document.
