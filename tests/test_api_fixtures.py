"""Replay real anonymized LEDM captures against the parser.

When ``tests/fixtures/<host>/`` contains XML captured from a real printer
and run through ``scripts/anonymize_ledm.py``, this test loads each
endpoint and asserts the parser produces a sensible ``ProductInfo`` and
``PrinterData``. The fixtures are intentionally optional: a fresh
checkout without them still passes the test, so CI does not fail.

To add a fixture:

    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/capture_ledm.py --host <your-printer>
    ./.venv/bin/python scripts/anonymize_ledm.py scripts/captures/<dir>/
    cp -r scripts/captures/<dir>-anon tests/fixtures/<short-name>/
