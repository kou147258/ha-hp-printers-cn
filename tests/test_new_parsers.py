"""Replay the real captures through the new parsers.

These are the tests that would have caught the two wrong readings found while
writing this code, and neither of them is findable from a hand-built sample:

- ``GetCommunityNameConfig`` is an enumeration whose only declared values are
  ``publicAllowed`` and ``publicNotAllowed``. A generic on/off test reports a
  printer permitting the default community string as switched off, because
  neither value contains "enabled". A hand-written fixture would have used
  whatever spelling the author imagined.
- ``SNMPConfigWithVersion`` on the LEDM side and ``snmpV1V2Config`` on the CDP
  side are the same fact in two shapes, and only reading the real documents
  shows that.

Every value asserted here came out of a printer, and every fixture is the
repository's own anonymized capture. Nothing in this file is invented, which
is the point: a parser can only be pinned to what the device actually said.
